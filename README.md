# Hangry

#Description
  Tired of reading through menus online to see if they have what you're craving? Look no further! Simply search for the food you want ("chicken wings", "meatball sandwich", etc) and enter your city or zip code. If we currently have the relevant restaurants in the database, we'll return specific menu items from restaurants that match your search within 10 miles. Hangry is powered by EatStreet which may not necessarily have menu item data for every restaurant in the city you searched.

#Installation
  To install and run Hangry locally:
    1.) cd into the directory you want to store the app files.

    3.) cd into Hangry.
    4.) run 'npm install' in your terminal.
    5.) run 'npm run react-dev' in one terminal tab and 'npm run server-dev' in another terminal tab.
    6.) Enter 'localhost:3000' in a browser window.
